		<h3>Majors</h3>
		<p>I am a Junior double majoring in Political Science and Digital Media Studies at the University of Rochester.</p>

		<h3>Hometown</h3>
		<p>Born at a young age, I was raised in a cave by wolves somewhere deep in the wilderness of Maryland.</p>

		<h3>School Life</h3>
		 <p>One night as I was fighting for my life with one of my wolf pack brethren during what started out as a friendly competition over scraps of rancid meat, I thought, “There has to be a better way”. And thus, I left the cave at the ripe age of 14 to pursue a higher education (I was able to jump right into high school; turns out being raised by wolves actually counts as substantial gen-ed credit).</p>

		 <h3>Interests, Skills & Accomplishments</h3>
		 <p>I graduated high school with honors and my graphic design experience, along with my love of writing and filming sketch comedy, and acting in plays came in handy during two internships I've engaged in.</p>

		<h3>Major</h3>
		<p>I am a sophomore pursing a Bachelor’s degree in Language, Media, and Communications (or English, in simpler terms) at the University of Rochester .</p>

		<h3>Hometown</h3>
		<p>I’ve essentially spent my entire life in Rochester as I was born and grew up here.</p>

		<h3>School Life</h3>
		<p> I fell in love with learning about art history, therefore I decided to shift my major towards Language, Media, and Communication. During my second semester, CSC 170 became my favorite class, which led me to decide to have a cluster in web design. After obtaining my Bachelor’s degree, I plan on attending the Warner School of Education here at UR to get a Master’s in Education.</p>

		<h3>Interests, Skills & Accomplishments</h3>
		 <p>I spend a lot of time making digital art, working a retail job at Greece Ridge Mall, and was also hired as a tutor for young children at LEAP which is the best job I’ve ever had.</p>
